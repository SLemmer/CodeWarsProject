# CodeWarsProject
Kata's I complete on Codewars

I am a product manager, not an engineer.  My interest in learning basic programing is to better relate to the engineers I deal with everyday. I enjoy 
coding, the very basic bit I know but more importantly it helps me understand the engineering process.
